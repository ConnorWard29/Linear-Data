Linked listed would be used when dealing with large lists of data, because unlike arrays, when adding to a linked list, only a few pieces of data need to be moved instead of all the data the occurs afterwards.

The differnce between a stack and a queue is their methods of accessing and adding data, with stacks using LIFO (Last in First out) and queues using FIFO (First in First out)

Developers may use a stack while writing a program if that program needs to collect and use data using the newest data first.

A situation where a developer would use an array instead of a list is when they are dealing with things that affect all the data in the data structure, such as muiltiplying or dividing intergers.
